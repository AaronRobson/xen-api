Xapi design details
===================

Before reading these, first familiarise yourself with the
[architecture](../architecture/README.md).

- [XenAPI evolution](XenAPI-evolution.md): the XenAPI lifecycle i.e. how the XenAPI evolves
  over time
- [memory accounting](memory-accounting.md): explains how the host memory
  is managed, in particular how the "VM overhead" and "host overhead" are
  calculated
- [backtraces](backtraces.md): how xapi collects and reports diagnostic
  backtraces across host and process boundaries
